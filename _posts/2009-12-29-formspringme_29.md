<div class="formspringmeQuestion">Today I got a very interesting question from one of my Twitter friends <a href="http://twitter.com/splattne">splattne</a>. The question was:
</div><div class="formspringmeQuestion"><a href="http://www.formspring.me/Galilyou/q/11132997">What can we (Europeans/Americans) learn from your culture? What can you learn from ours?</a>     
</div><div class="formspringmeQuestion">
</div><div class="formspringmeQuestion">Here's how I answered the question:
</div><div class="formspringmeQuestion">
</div><div class="formspringmeAnswer"><i>Wow, that's a big one! 
I really like your question, Stefan. This kind of constructive thinking is one of the most important methods we can use to avoid conflicts (which might eventually develop wars, and bad stuff).
I will start by what I think that we can learn from you: </i>
</div><div class="formspringmeAnswer"><i>
<b> 1- Hardwork:</b></i>
</div><div class="formspringmeAnswer"><i> yes, we're lazy people. Even for the poorer countries (like mine) people are satisfied by working less and gaining less (less than enough). </i>
</div><div class="formspringmeAnswer"><i>
<b> 2- Democracy:</b></i>
</div><div class="formspringmeAnswer"><i> I'm not gonna through a discussion with this because it's very obvious for everyone that democracy in our countries is just a shallow word. I mean, come on, every president is preparing for his son to take his place nowadays. This is happening in Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, and many others. </i>
</div><div class="formspringmeAnswer"><i>
<b> 3- How to learn and teach: </b></i>
</div><div class="formspringmeAnswer"><i>Education systems in most (if not all) of the Arabic countries are ridiculously inefficient. Chemistry students here enters the chemistry lab one or two times for the whole semester. </i>
</div><div class="formspringmeAnswer"><i>
<b> What can you learn from us: </b></i>
</div><div class="formspringmeAnswer"><i>
<b> 1- Socializing:</b></i>
</div><div class="formspringmeAnswer"><i><b></b> Around here the social relationships are much much better that there in US and Europe. </i>
</div><div class="formspringmeAnswer"><i>
<b> 2- Conviction:</b></i>
</div><div class="formspringmeAnswer"><i> Though poor is everywhere, we are not so obsessive with money! A little can satisfy us. </i>
</div><div class="formspringmeAnswer"><i>
<b> 3- Harmony:</b> </i>
</div><div class="formspringmeAnswer"><i>Different races live together with harmony and love. I've never heard (in an Arabic community) that some one shot another because of his skin color.</i>
</div><div class="formspringmeAnswer"><i>
At the end, the thing that can really teach you a lot is the Arabic History. We are a bunch of shallow nations nowadays, our influence on the outer environment is very weak, but once we were a real example of a united, well educated, merciful, and highly organized nation. 
Thank you again for asking this question Stefan, and I really hope if my answer helps.</i>

</div><div class="formspringmeFooter">What do you think dear reader? What else can we learn from the Europeans/Americans (the good things)? And what can they learn from us(only the good things)?
