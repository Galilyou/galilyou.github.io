As it is gaining popularity day by day,and as everyone I know likes it, I thought .. well, let's give it a try.<br />Git is a powerful source control system. It's free, and open source. It's pretty simple to use, it's intended to handle&nbsp;both small and large projects, and it's so freakingly FAST.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_CvP3b8RZYyc/S1WFeceVIxI/AAAAAAAAAEk/1V3HDGbOHBg/s1600-h/chp_rocket.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_CvP3b8RZYyc/S1WFeceVIxI/AAAAAAAAAEk/1V3HDGbOHBg/s320/chp_rocket.jpg" /></a></div><br /><br />Unlike SVN and TFS, Git is not centeralized. This means that every Git clone is a fully fledged repository with all versions and history information&nbsp;available.<br /><br />Git is written in C (well, mostly) and is available for many platforms. If you are a linux guy you can download Git from <a href="http://git-scm.com/">here</a>&nbsp;and if you are a Windows fellow then download <a href="http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/">msygit</a>.<br /><br />This post is aimed to be a tutorial introduction to Git. Together we will walk through the process of creating the repository, adding initial files to the&nbsp;repository, committing those files, changing them, creating branches, viewing differences, resolving conflicts, merging and finally pushing to the&nbsp;centeralized repository.<br /><br />Now to get started let's assume that you want to create a simple project which is basically an html file, a bunch of javascript files and a css file.&nbsp;Pick whatever directory you wish to create your initial files. After you're done right click the directory containing your files and select "Git Bash&nbsp;Here" (assuming that you already installed msygit). A command window will show up, to initialize your repository enter:<br /><pre class="cpp" name="code">git init-db<br /></pre>This will create the repository for you (and will also create a default "master" branch). Now enter:<br /><pre class="cpp" name="code">git add -a<br /></pre>to add all the files in this directory to the repository. You can select specific files by specifying the required file name like so:<br /><pre class="cpp" name="code">git add filename.css<br /></pre>The selected files are now tracked by Git to your repsoitory, to commit those files to the repository (the LOCAL repository, remember?) :<br /><pre class="cpp" name="code">git commit -a<br /></pre>This will open vim for you to enter a commit message. Enter your message, and quite vi, then Git will commit your changes to the DB.<br /><br /><b>Note:&nbsp;</b><br /><i>If you're not familiar with vim or vi, to quite the editor saving the changes type ":wq" -that's colon wq- or ":q" to quit without saving.&nbsp;Or you can specify -m to the git commit command followed by the message you want in double quotes, like so:&nbsp;</i><br /><pre class="cpp" name="code">git commit -a -m "my initial commit"<br /></pre><br />Now try editing some files and then, to view the changes, type:<br /><pre class="cpp" name="code">git diff<br /></pre>This will highlight the changes between your uncommitted version and the last committed version.&nbsp;If you want to see the history of your changes at any time, user:<br /><pre class="cpp" name="code">git whatchanged<br /></pre>or use:<br /><pre class="cpp" name="code">git whatchanged -p<br /></pre>to see the complete differences at each change.<br /><br />The very cool thing about Git is how easily it enables you to create new branches. For example, if you want to create an expreimental function inside a&nbsp;class file you're working on or inside a javascript file but you want it away from the master branch, you can easily create a new branch, checkout&nbsp;this branch, edit your file, and all the changes will be completely isolated from the master branch. To create a new branch:<br /><pre class="cpp" name="code">git branch testBranch<br />git branch<br /></pre>The first command will create testBranch for you and the second command will list all the available branches on your repository (by far there should be only&nbsp;testBranch and the master branch "master").<br /><br /><b>Note:</b> <i>The selected branch has an * displayed before it.&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i><br />Now enter :<br /><pre class="cpp" name="code">git &nbsp;checkout testBranch<br /></pre>to switch to the newly created branch. Try editing somefiles, and show the diffs.<br /><pre class="cpp" name="code">git diff<br /></pre>You should now see the changes you made, commit those changes. And switch to the master branch:<br /><pre class="cpp" name="code">git commit -a<br />git checkout master<br /></pre>If you look at the files you just edited when you were on testBranch -after switching to the master branch- you would notice that the changes you made while you were on testBranch are gone.&nbsp;However, if you switch to the testBranch again you will see your changes there. If you're happy with the changes you made on testBranch, you can merge&nbsp;those changes to the master branch by using the following command:<br /><pre class="cpp" name="code">git merge testBranch<br /></pre>If there is no confilcts, you're allset. If there are conflicts you will have to resolve them manually and then commit the file. Git will show you&nbsp;which files have conflicts.<br />Now, if you are done with the test branch and want to delte it, use:<br /><pre class="cpp" name="code">git branch -d testBranch<br /></pre><br />If you used to be a TFS and VSS guy like myself, take a deep sigh of relief and enjoy Git.<br />I will try to blog more on Git on the next posts, stay tuned!
