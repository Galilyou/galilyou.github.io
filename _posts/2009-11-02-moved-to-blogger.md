Yes, though this is my first post here, I’ve been into blogging before! I’ve been maintaining my old <a href="http://halwagy.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">blog</a> for a while now. I decided to go on and try Blogger. I’m not unsatisfied with Wordpress at all, actually, I quite like it. I just wanted to try Blogger. And since the best way to try something is, well, actually try it, I decided to move my latest blog posts to here. 


Blogging for Cowards 101:

<ol><li><span style="color: #666666;"><strong>What is a coward?</strong> </span>
A coward is an intelligent trained professional, armed with a powerful brain and likes to explore new things, wastes his time banging onto a modern typing machine, hates compilers, loves WoW, and ultimately is scared of the world ending without him learning enough

We will figure it out together!

</li><li> <span style="color: #666666;"><strong>How can this blog help you?</strong></span>
Sharing is caring, you know? Yeah, I’m scared too. I will share any new stuff I learn about onto this blog, I will even share my own thoughts (don’t waste your time on those)
</li></ol>
So, are you with me, are you a coward? I hope so. Life is not fun without learning, and 2012 is so close, we have a lot work to do! Time is running out, life is running out. So let’s get started, shall we? Ladies and Gents!?
