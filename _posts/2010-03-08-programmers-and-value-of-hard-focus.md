There was a very <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/b8qho/how_many_hours_of_pure_work_do_you_put_in_a_day/">interesting </a>discussion on <a href="http://reddit.com/">reddit </a>a few days ago. Some fresh programmer asked how many pure work hours do programmers work per day?<br /><br /><br />By pure work he meant, the number of hours spent on (coding/designing/testing, etc.) a task that is probably assigned to him by&nbsp;one of his superiors. Other activities like personal researching, blogging, etc. are not counted.<br /><br />The question sound pretty interesting to me and the answers came much more interesting.<br /><br />Most of the answers implied that programmers put less that four hours of pure work per day. This is half the assumed time (8 hours for most&nbsp;companies).<br /><div><br /></div><div><div>So, why do programmers work less than most of other carriers' professionals? An immediate answer that might came to my mind "well, that's normal because they are sloths lazy."&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.supercoloring.com/wp-content/thumbnail/2009_04/lazy-programmer-coloring-page.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="304" src="http://www.supercoloring.com/wp-content/thumbnail/2009_04/lazy-programmer-coloring-page.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div><br /></div><div><b>False Assumption:</b></div><div>&nbsp;If I don't work HARD I will eventually fail to finish my work, and will certainly feel incompetent.</div><div><br /></div><div><div><b>There's a lot to programming than HARD work:</b>&nbsp;</div><div>For me, it doesn't matter how many hours I work during the day. What matters most, however, is the number of tasks I manage to finish. This&nbsp;is ths only productivity metric to me, and it's not related to the number of working hours, it's related to the number of hours (or minutes)&nbsp;I managed to keep my focus hard.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><div><b>The value of Hard Focus:&nbsp;</b></div><div>Haruki Murakami in his excellent memori (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/What-Talk-About-When-Running/dp/0307269191">What I Talk About When I Talk About Running</a>) noted:&nbsp;</div><div><i>If I’m asked what the next most important quality is for a novelist, that’s easy too: focus the ability to &nbsp;concentrate all your limited&nbsp;talents on whatever’s critical at the moment. Without that you can’t accomplish anything of value</i>.</div><div><br /></div><div><div>The key is to concentrate all your mental abilities on one specific task and foreget about anything else as long as you're working on this&nbsp;one task. This is very important -actually a lot of programming techniques and tools are proven usefeul and highly adopted because it lets&nbsp;you forget about other details and foucs on your specific task.</div><div><br /></div><div>Luckily enough, Marukami pointed that: "<b><i>Fortunately [sustaining focus for a long period of time] can be acquired and sharpened through training</i></b>."</div><div><br /></div><div><div><b>Pomodoro</b>:&nbsp;</div><div>The <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">pomodoro technique</a> is designed to address this very problem. It's mainly focused on helping you stay focused by working for shorter&nbsp;periods of time, named pomodoros, each is 25 minutes long and during each you're focused on only one task. And while working on this one&nbsp;task you are not allowed to think or worry about anything else. This really helps you cultivate all your energy on attacking one problem.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><b>Conclusion:&nbsp;</b></div><div>The number of working hours is not that crucial in CS-related carriers or any other carrier that requires a non-trivial amout on creativity.&nbsp;What matters most is to keep your mind clear, break your problem into smaller problems, and focus on these smaller problems one at a time.</div><div><br /></div><div>Now I see (and hopefully you dear reader) what every GTD book meant when they loudly screamed in readers' faces "<b>WORK SMART NOT HARD</b>"!</div><div><br /></div><div>What do you think dear reader?&nbsp;</div></div></div>
