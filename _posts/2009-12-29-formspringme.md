<b><br /></b><br /><b>ASK ME ANYTHING</b><br /><br />Today I came a cross this <a href="http://formspring.me/">site</a>. The main idea here is that people can ask each other questions and get them to answer them. It also integrates with a lot of other sites like <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a>, etc.&nbsp;There are a lot of my twitter friends on FormSpring.<br />I think the idea is simple and very appealing. Take a look at it and feel free to ask me anything <a href="http://formspring.me/Galilyou" target="_blank">http://formspring.me/Galilyou</a>
