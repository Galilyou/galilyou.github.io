A while ago I posted two little polls about the favorited isolation framework, and ORM. The results of the two posts were as follows

Which ORM?
1- NHibernate      49%(44 votes)
2- LLBLGEN         34%(31 votes)
3- Entity Framework 6%(6 votes)
4- LINQ to SQL      6%(6 votes)
5- Subsonice        2%(2 votes)

Which Isolation Framework?
1- Typemock Isolator 50%(10 votes)
2- Moq    45%(9 votes)
3- NMock2  5%(1 votes)
4- RhinoMocks   0%(0 votes)
5- Stubs  0%(0 votes)

For myself I voted for NHibernate and Moq. I know all of those tools are purely awesome, though.

So, dear reader, do you have any other suggestions for an ORM or an Isolation Framework?
