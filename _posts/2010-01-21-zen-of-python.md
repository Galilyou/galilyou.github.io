I found these fantastic guiding principles of the design of Python published <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">here </a>by Tim Peters, and &nbsp;once I saw them, I was like, Man! I ought to share these, so look them up on the site, or if you don't want to leave programming for COWARDS just yet, I'm quoting them here for you ;) &nbsp;: <br /><br /><i><b>The Zen of Python</b></i><br /><i><br /></i><br /><i>Beautiful is better than ugly.</i><br /><i>Explicit is better than implicit.</i><br /><i>Simple is better than complex.</i><br /><i>Complex is better than complicated.</i><br /><i>Flat is better than nested.</i><br /><i>Sparse is better than dense.</i><br /><i>Readability counts.</i><br /><i>Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.</i><br /><i>Although practicality beats purity.</i><br /><i>Errors should never pass silently.</i><br /><i>Unless explicitly silenced.</i><br /><i>In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.</i><br /><i>There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.</i><br /><i>Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.</i><br /><i>Now is better than never.</i><br /><i>Although never is often better than *right* now.</i><br /><i>If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.</i><br /><i>If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.</i><br /><i>Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!</i><br /><br />Those quotes are pure gold. One could think of writing them down on a board and keep that board hanged&nbsp;in front&nbsp;of his eyes, right above the computer screen!<br /><br />Awesome, awesome stuff!
