I'm a Software Developer working mainly on the Microsoft stack. I build solutions for the web and I love it.

In this blog I will be writing about different set of technologies: ASP.NET MVC / Web API / Core MVC with C#, JavaScript, and other various server and client side stuff.

I also like [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and will probably be writting about it a lot more in the near future; so something for you, dear reader, to look forward to.
